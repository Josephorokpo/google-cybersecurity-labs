# **README: Home Office Network Asset Inventory and Classification**

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on establishing a fundamental component of a robust cybersecurity plan for a home-based business: **asset management**. It involves creating a comprehensive inventory of devices connected to a home office network, classifying these assets based on their sensitivity, and identifying potential risks. This systematic approach is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information, ensuring operational continuity, and maintaining data integrity.

## **Purpose**

The primary purpose of this project is to:

* **Identify Assets:** Catalog all devices that connect to or are part of the home office network.  
* **Characterize Assets:** Document essential details for each device, including its network access frequency, responsible owner, and physical location.  
* **Evaluate Information:** Analyze the type of information stored or processed on each device and how it interacts with the network.  
* **Classify Sensitivity:** Assign a sensitivity level to each asset to prioritize security measures and resource allocation.

By following this methodology, organizations (even small home-based businesses) can gain critical insights into their digital footprint, enabling them to implement targeted security controls and proactively mitigate risks.

## **Project Structure**

The core output of this project is a detailed Markdown document titled "Home Office Network Asset Inventory and Classification" (asset-inventory-and-classification-report). This document contains:

1. **Introduction:** An overview of asset management and its importance.  
2. **Asset Inventory and Classification Table:** A table listing identified assets, their characteristics, notes on their usage and risks, and their assigned sensitivity.  
3. **Sensitivity Categories Table:** A guide outlining the sensitivity classifications and their corresponding access designations.  
4. **Conclusion:** A summary of the benefits derived from this asset management exercise. 

## **Benefits**

Implementing this asset inventory and classification process provides several key benefits:

* **Enhanced Security Posture:** Clearly identifies high-value and sensitive assets, allowing for focused security efforts.  
* **Risk Mitigation:** Helps in understanding potential vulnerabilities and proactive measures to prevent data breaches or unauthorized access.  
* **Resource Optimization:** Guides the allocation of security resources (time, tools, budget) to where they are most needed.  
* **Compliance (if applicable):** Lays the groundwork for compliance with data protection regulations, even for small businesses.  
* **Improved Awareness:** Increases awareness among users about the sensitivity of information and the importance of device security.
