# **Home Office Network Asset Inventory and Classification**

## **1\. Introduction**

Effective asset management is a cornerstone of a robust cybersecurity strategy for any organization, regardless of size. For a home-based business, understanding and protecting your digital assets is paramount to safeguarding sensitive information, maintaining operational continuity, and ensuring data integrity. This document details the process of creating an inventory of network-connected devices within a home office environment, classifying them based on their sensitivity, and identifying potential risks.

The goal of this exercise is to:

* Identify all devices connected to the home network.  
* Document key characteristics for each device, including network access, ownership, and physical location.  
* Evaluate the type of information stored or processed by each device and its connection methods.  
* Assign a sensitivity classification to each asset to prioritize protection efforts.

By systematically categorizing assets, we can implement targeted security controls, allocate resources effectively, and proactively mitigate risks that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical business and personal information.

## **2\. Asset Inventory and Classification**

The following table provides a detailed inventory of selected devices connected to the home office network, along with their characteristics, notes on their usage and potential risks, and their assigned sensitivity classification.

| Asset | Network Access | Owner | Location | Notes | Sensitivity |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Network router | Continuous | Internet service provider (ISP) | On-premises | Has a 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz connection. All devices on the home network connect to the 5 GHz frequency. | Confidential |
| Desktop | Occasional | Homeowner | On-premises | Contains private information, like photos. | Restricted |
| Guest smartphone | Occasional | Friend | On and off-premises | Connects to my home network. | Internal-only |
| External hard drive | Occasional | Homeowner | On-premises | Contains music and movies. | Confidential |
| Streaming media player | Continuous | Homeowner | On-premises | Payment card information is stored for movie rentals. | Internal-only |
| Portable game console | Occasional | Friend | On and off-premises | Has a camera and microphone. | Internal-only |
| Smart TV | Continuous | Homeowner | On-premises | Used for streaming content and has integrated apps. May store viewing habits. | Internal-only |
| Smart speaker | Continuous | Homeowner | On-premises | Voice-activated assistant, records commands and potentially conversations. Connected to various smart home devices. | Confidential |
| Wireless printer | Occasional | Homeowner | On-premises | Can store print job history and connect to cloud services for remote printing. | Internal-only |

## **3\. Sensitivity Categories**

The following table outlines the sensitivity categories used for classifying assets, along with their corresponding access designations. This guide helps in determining the appropriate level of protection required for each asset.

| Category | Access Designation |
| :---- | :---- |
| Restricted | Need-to-know |
| Confidential | Limited to specific users |
| Internal-only | Users on-premises |
| Public | Anyone |

## **4\. Conclusion**

The process of creating a comprehensive asset inventory and classifying assets based on their sensitivity is a fundamental step in establishing a strong security posture for a home office network. By understanding the nature of each device, the information it handles, and its potential vulnerabilities, we can proactively implement security measures that align with the asset's importance. This systematic approach ensures that critical assets receive the highest level of protection, thereby minimizing risks of data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruptions. Regular review and updates to this inventory are essential to maintain its accuracy and effectiveness as the network evolves.
