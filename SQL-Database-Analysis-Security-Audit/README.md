# **SQL Database Analysis for Security Audit**

## **Project Introduction**

This repository contains a practical project demonstrating the application of SQL (Structured Query Language) for cybersecurity analysis. As a security analyst, the ability to query and interpret data from organizational databases is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities, monitoring activity, and investigating potential security incidents. This project focuses on two key areas: assessing employee device update statuses and auditing user login activity for anomalies.

## **Scenario**

The scenario involves a need to determine which employee devices require updates and to investigate user login activity for any unusual patterns. The necessary information is stored in an organizational database within the machines and login\_attempts tables.

## **Objectives**

The primary objectives of this analysis were to:

1. **Obtain comprehensive information on employee devices** to identify those requiring updates.  
2. **Examine user login activity** to detect any suspicious or unusual access patterns.  
3. **Utilize SQL's ORDER BY clause** to sort and organize query results for better readability and analysis.

## **Tools and Technologies**

* **Database System:** MariaDB  
* **Language:** SQL (Structured Query Language)

## **Analysis and Findings**

The analysis involved constructing and executing various SQL queries against the organization database. The findings from each query contributed to a clearer understanding of the current state of employee devices and login behaviors.

A detailed report of the analysis, including all queries and their outputs, is available in the SQL\_Query\_Analysis\_Report.md file.

## **Key Learnings**

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in:

* **Basic SQL Syntax:** Using SELECT and FROM clauses.  
* **Column Selection:** Retrieving specific columns or all data using \*.  
* **Data Ordering:** Sorting query results using ORDER BY with single and multiple columns.  
* **Database Interaction:** Simulating interaction with a relational database for security purposes.  
* **Security Auditing:** Applying SQL skills to practical security auditing tasks like patch management and anomaly detection.
