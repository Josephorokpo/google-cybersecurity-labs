# **Linux File Management Lab**

## **Project Introduction**

This repository contains a detailed walkthrough of a hands-on lab activity focused on fundamental Linux command-line operations for modifying directory structures and managing files. As a security analyst, the ability to create, remove, move, and edit directories and files is a core task for organizing data, managing system configurations, and maintaining a secure and efficient environment.

## **Scenario**

The lab scenario involved reorganizing the /home/analyst directory to a new, optimized structure. This required creating new directories, removing old ones, moving existing files, deleting unneeded files, and creating/editing a new file to document the changes.

## **Tools and Commands Used**

* **Operating System:** Debian-based Linux (within a virtual machine)  
* **Shell:** Bash  
* **Commands:**  
  * mkdir: Make Directory  
  * rm: Remove files or directories  
  * mv: Move or rename files/directories  
  * touch: Change file timestamps / Create empty files  
  * nano: Simple text editor  
  * ls: List directory contents  
  * cd: Change Directory  
  * pwd: Print Working Directory  
  * clear: Clear the terminal screen

## **Lab Walkthrough and Results**

The full, step-by-step execution of the lab, including all commands executed and their corresponding outputs, is documented in the Linux\_File\_Management\_Lab\_Report.md file within this repository. This report serves as a complete record of the practical activity.

## **Key Learnings**

This activity provided valuable hands-on experience in:

* **Directory Management:** Creating and removing directories (mkdir, rm \-r).  
* **File Operations:** Moving (mv), deleting (rm), and creating (touch) files.  
* **Text Editing:** Using the nano text editor to modify file contents.  
* **File System Organization:** Understanding how to structure directories for better data management.  
* **Linux Administration Fundamentals:** Practicing essential skills for managing data in a Linux environment.
