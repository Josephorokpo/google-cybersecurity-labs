# **Commercial Bank Cybersecurity Risk Register**

## **Project Overview**

This repository contains a comprehensive **Risk Register** for a commercial bank, designed to demonstrate a professional approach to cybersecurity risk management. The core document, "Risk Register: Commercial Bank Cybersecurity Assessment," provides a structured methodology for identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing potential cybersecurity risks. This initiative aligns with best practices from frameworks like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), emphasizing proactive risk assessment to enhance an organization's security posture.

## **Core Document: Risk Register: Commercial Bank Cybersecurity Assessment**

The primary artifact of this project is the **Risk Register: Commercial Bank Cybersecurity Assessment** Canvas. This detailed Markdown document outlines:

* **Executive Summary:** A high-level overview of the risk assessment's purpose and scope.  
* **Operational Environment Analysis:** A thorough examination of the bank's specific context, including its location, personnel, customer base, marketing activities, and regulatory landscape, all of which influence its risk profile.  
* **Risk Assessment Methodology:** A clear explanation of the approach used to quantify risks, utilizing the formula: LikelihoodÃ—Severity=Risk Priority. It defines the scoring scales for likelihood (1-3) and severity (1-3) and includes a sample risk matrix.  
* **Risk Register Table:** A central record detailing identified risks to the bank's funds, complete with descriptions, estimated likelihood, severity scores, and calculated priority levels. This section also includes detailed notes on how security events are possible within the bank's operating environment for each risk.  
* **Prioritization and Mitigation Recommendations:** Actionable insights derived from the risk scores, providing specific recommendations for addressing the most critical vulnerabilities.  
* **Conclusion:** A summary emphasizing the importance of continuous risk management and the dynamic nature of this register.
